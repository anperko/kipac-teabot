KIPAC TeaBot
============

Copyright (c) 2017 [Yao-Yuan Mao](https://yymao.github.io)

KIPAC TeaBot is an automatic system which browses through new arXiv astro-ph papers everyday and sends personal suggestions to subscribers. It also sends discussion suggestions to Tea orangizers, and discovers new papers that are authored by KIPAC members.

Currently this system is open to only KIPAC members. If you are a member of KIPAC and want to become a subscriber, please talk to Joe DeRose or Phil Marshall. There is a plan to expand this service and to open it for all, or to make the system easy to install. If you are interested in this, please [contact Yao](mailto:yymao.astro@gmail.com?subject=TeaBot) as well.

Current subscribers, please [create an issue](https://github.com/yymao/kipac-teabot/issues/new) to report a bug or to request a feature.
